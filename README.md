## ðŸš€ Features

- **Accounts**  
  Easily create new service accounts by providing a name. Click the `Create Account With Name:` button to initiate the creation process.

- **Keys**  
  When creating a key, a corresponding **private key** (`.pem` file) is generated. This private key is required to generate an access token and cannot be retrieved again later â€” so be sure to download and store it securely. The app will prompt you to save it as `<key-id>.pem`.

- **Access Tokens**  
  - Generate tokens using your stored `.pem` file and selected scopes.  
  - Scopes are specified as a space-separated string, e.g.:
    ```
    data:read data:write
    ```
  - Use the `Copy Token` button to copy the `access_token` value to your clipboard.  
  - You can also open the token in [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to inspect its claims.
